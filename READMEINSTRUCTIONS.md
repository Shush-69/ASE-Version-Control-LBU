  to issues with the file format chosen to save and load in)
  
  *THE BELOW WAS PASTED FROM THE MARK SHEET OF THE MODULE*
  
  Programming commands – 30 marks
The idea here is that it behaves like a proper programming language with sequence,
selection and iteration.
  
If statement (5 marks)
  
2 marks for one line
  
3 marks for block with “endif”

  (if i remeber correctly this is one of the featres i had added however i dont think it works as i desired it to)
